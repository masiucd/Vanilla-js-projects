# Vanilla js projects λ😎🚀

* [Meal Db](#mealdb)

Vanilla js projects with no framework. Good to practice on vanilla javascript projects to sharpen the skills.
Not big projects but small tiny ones that focus on the core language. ⚛️💪🏻🤓

It's important to understand how Javascript works under hood, how to use clojure's λ🃏 in javascript and how scope works in _JS_.
